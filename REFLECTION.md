1. My assistant was personal to me because I added tasks from my to-do list and also gave my assistant a name I thought was special.

2. It was tricky understanding that this refers to the specific assistant object calling the method.

3. The method that I would improve is completetask() because I want it to let me choose which task to remove instead of it being the first always.
